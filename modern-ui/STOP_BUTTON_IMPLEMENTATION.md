# Stop Button Dynamic Visibility Implementation

## Overview
The Stop button and Stop command in the context menu are now dynamically controlled based on the execution state. They are hidden by default and only appear when code is actually running/executing.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Stop Button Visibility
- **Default State**: Hidden (`display: none`)
- **During Execution**: Visible (`display: flex`)
- **After Execution**: Hidden again

### 2. Context Menu Stop Command
- **Default State**: Not shown in context menu
- **During Execution**: Appears in context menu
- **After Execution**: Removed from context menu

### 3. Execution State Tracking
- Global `isExecuting` variable is exposed via `window.isExecuting`
- Updated whenever execution starts or stops
- Context menu checks this variable to determine Stop command visibility

## Code Changes

### TypeScript Files Modified:
1. **`modern-editor.ts`**:
   - Added dynamic context menu generation
   - Stop command only appears when `isExecuting` is true or Stop button is visible

2. **`modern-app.ts`**:
   - Exposed `isExecuting` variable globally
   - Updated global reference whenever execution state changes

### JavaScript Files Compiled:
1. **`modern-editor.js`** - Compiled from TypeScript
2. **`modern-app.js`** - Compiled from TypeScript

## How It Works

### Execution Start:
1. User clicks Run button
2. `isExecuting` is set to `true`
3. `window.isExecuting` is updated
4. Stop button becomes visible
5. Context menu will show Stop command

### Execution Stop:
1. Execution completes or user clicks Stop
2. `isExecuting` is set to `false`
3. `window.isExecuting` is updated
4. Stop button becomes hidden
5. Context menu will hide Stop command

## Testing

### Test Pages Created:
1. **`context-menu-debug.html`** - Basic context menu testing
2. **`stop-button-test.html`** - Comprehensive execution state monitoring

### Test Instructions:
1. Open `http://localhost:8000/stop-button-test.html`
2. Right-click in the editor to see context menu
3. Click Run button to start execution
4. Notice Stop button appears and Stop command appears in context menu
5. Click Stop or wait for execution to complete
6. Notice Stop button disappears and Stop command is removed from context menu

## Features

### ✅ Stop Button:
- Hidden by default
- Appears only during execution
- Disappears when execution stops

### ✅ Context Menu Stop Command:
- Not shown by default
- Appears only during execution
- Disappears when execution stops

### ✅ Execution State Tracking:
- Global `isExecuting` variable
- Real-time updates
- Synchronized with UI elements

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- Uses standard DOM APIs
- No external dependencies for state management

## Performance
- Minimal overhead
- State updates only when execution changes
- Efficient context menu generation
