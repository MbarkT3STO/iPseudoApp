Algorithm CorrectedFeaturesTest
# Test corrected syntax

# 1. Variable keyword works like var
Variable count = 42
var traditionalVar = 100
Print "Variable keyword:", count
Print "Traditional var:", traditionalVar

# 2. Set syntax with actual values (not "value" keyword)
Set 50 To count
Set "Updated message" To message
Set false To flag

Print "After Set operations:"
Print "count:", count
Print "message:", message
Print "flag:", flag

# 3. Declare As Type syntax
Declare age As Number
Declare name As String
Declare isActive As Boolean

Set 25 To age
Set "Alice" To name
Set true To isActive

Print "Typed variables:"
Print "age:", age
Print "name:", name
Print "isActive:", isActive
