Algorithm FinalFeaturesTest
# Test all features working together

# 1. Variable keyword works like var
Variable count = 0
var traditionalCount = 0

# 2. Set...To syntax works like = operator
Set 10 To count
Set 20 To traditionalCount

# 3. Mixed usage
Variable name = "Test"
Set "Updated Name" To name

# 4. Declare As Type syntax
Declare age As Number
Set 25 To age

# 5. Test output
Print "Variable keyword count:", count
Print "Traditional var count:", traditionalCount
Print "Name:", name
Print "Age:", age

# 6. Test with expressions
Set count + 5 To count
Set name + " - Extended" To name

Print "After expressions:"
Print "Count:", count
Print "Name:", name
