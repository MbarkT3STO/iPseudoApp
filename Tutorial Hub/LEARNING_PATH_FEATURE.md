# 🗺️ Interactive Learning Path Graph - Feature Documentation

## Overview

The **Interactive Learning Path Graph** is a visual network diagram that shows all 20 lessons in the iPseudo Tutorial Hub, their relationships, and dependencies. It helps students understand the learning journey at a glance and plan their study route effectively.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Visualize the Big Picture**: See how all lessons connect
- **Understand Prerequisites**: Know what to learn before tackling advanced topics
- **Plan Your Path**: Choose the most efficient learning route
- **Track Progress**: See completed, in-progress, and pending lessons
- **Interactive Navigation**: Click to jump directly to any lesson

## 📍 Access

- **URL**: `learning-path.html`
- **Navigation**: Available from main menu "Learning Path" link
- **Promoted**: Featured card on the index page

## 🎨 Features

### Visual Network Diagram
- **Nodes**: Each lesson is a colored box
- **Edges**: Arrows show prerequisites and dependencies
- **Colors**: 
  - Progress-based (completed, in-progress, pending)
  - Level-based for pending lessons (beginner=green, intermediate=blue, advanced=purple)

### Interactive Controls
1. **Click & Drag**: Pan around the graph
2. **Scroll**: Zoom in/out
3. **Click Nodes**: Navigate directly to that lesson
4. **Reset Zoom**: Return to default zoom level
5. **Fit to Screen**: Auto-fit entire graph in viewport
6. **Toggle Physics**: Enable/disable force simulation

### Layout Modes
- **Hierarchical (Default)**: Top-down organized view showing clear progression
- **Force-Directed**: Physics-based organic layout with attractive/repulsive forces

### Real-Time Updates
- Graph automatically updates when you complete lessons
- Colors change to reflect your current progress
- Uses localStorage to track state

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Vis.js Network**: Graph visualization library
- **LocalStorage**: Progress persistence
