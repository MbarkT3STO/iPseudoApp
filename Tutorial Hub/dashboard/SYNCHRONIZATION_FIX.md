# Dashboard Synchronization Fix

## Problem
The dashboard and lesson pages were using **different localStorage keys** for progress tracking, causing them to be out of sync:

- **Lesson Pages** (`tutorial-features.js`): Used `tutorial-progress` with format:
  ```json
  {
    "completed": ["01", "02", "03"],
    "inProgress": ["04"]
  }
  ```

- **Dashboard** (`dashboard-data.js`): Used `lessonProgress` with format:
  ```json
  {
    "lesson-1": "completed",
    "lesson-2": "completed",
    "lesson-3": "completed",
    "lesson-4": "in-progress"
  }
  ```

## Solution
Updated `dashboard-data.js` to:
1. Read from the **same localStorage key** (`tutorial-progress`) that lessons use
2. Convert the data format on-the-fly to match dashboard's expected structure
3. Use `lesson-timestamps` for accurate activity tracking (same as lessons)

## What Now Works
âœ… **Mark as Complete** button in lessons â†’ Updates dashboard immediately  
âœ… **Statistics Page** â†’ Already was synchronized (uses `tutorial-progress`)  
âœ… **Dashboard Charts** â†’ Now show real lesson completion data  
âœ… **Recent Activity** â†’ Uses actual completion timestamps  
âœ… **Certificates** â†’ Check real lesson progress for eligibility  

## Testing
1. Go to any lesson page (e.g., `01-introduction-to-pseudocode.html`)
2. Click **"Mark as Complete"** button
3. Go to **Dashboard** (`dashboard/index.html`)
4. See the lesson count and charts update!
5. Go to **Statistics** (`statistics.html`)
6. See the progress reflected there too!

## Files Changed
- `Tutorial Hub/dashboard/dashboard-data.js` - Updated to read from `tutorial-progress` and `lesson-timestamps`

## Files Already Synchronized
- `Tutorial Hub/js/tutorial-features.js` - Lesson progress tracking (unchanged)
- `Tutorial Hub/statistics.html` - Already used `tutorial-progress` (unchanged)
- `Tutorial Hub/certificates/certificate-data.js` - Already checks lesson completion (unchanged)
- `Tutorial Hub/quizzes/quiz-manager.js` - Has its own separate tracking (unchanged)

**Everything is now synchronized across the entire Tutorial Hub platform! ðŸŽ‰**
