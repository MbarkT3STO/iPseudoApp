# Learning Path Graph Synchronization Fix

## Problem
The learning path graph was not reflecting the user's actual lesson progress. It was using a different localStorage key (`lessonProgress`) than the one used by the lesson pages (`tutorial-progress`).

## Solution
Updated the learning path graph to read from the same synchronized localStorage key (`tutorial-progress`) that the lesson pages use, just like we did for the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### File: `js/learning-path-graph.js`

**1. Updated `getLessonProgress()` function:**
- Changed from reading `lessonProgress` to `tutorial-progress`
- Added conversion logic to transform the data format
- Now properly syncs with lesson completion tracking

**2. Updated storage event listener:**
- Changed from listening to `lessonProgress` changes to `tutorial-progress` changes
- Graph now updates in real-time when lessons are marked complete

## Data Format Conversion

**Lesson Pages Format (tutorial-progress):**
```json
{
  "completed": ["01", "02", "03"],
  "inProgress": ["04"]
}
```

**Graph Internal Format:**
```json
{
  "lesson-1": "completed",
  "lesson-2": "completed",
  "lesson-3": "completed",
  "lesson-4": "in-progress"
}
```

## Synchronized Systems

Now all three systems are synchronized:
1. âœ… **Lesson Pages** (`tutorial-features.js`) â†’ Writes to `tutorial-progress`
2. âœ… **Dashboard** (`dashboard-data.js`) â†’ Reads from `tutorial-progress`
3. âœ… **Learning Path Graph** (`learning-path-graph.js`) â†’ Reads from `tutorial-progress`
4. âœ… **Statistics Page** (`statistics.html`) â†’ Reads from `tutorial-progress`

## Testing

1. Go to any lesson page (e.g., `01-introduction-to-pseudocode.html`)
2. Click **"Mark as Complete"** button
3. Go to **Learning Path Graph** (`learning-path.html`)
4. See the corresponding node change color to **green** (completed)!

**All systems now properly synchronized! ðŸŽ‰**
