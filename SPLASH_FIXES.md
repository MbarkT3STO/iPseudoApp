# Splash Screen Fixes - Complete Debug Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Theme Synchronization
**Problem**: Splash screen theme not syncing with app settings
**Root Cause**: Theme is stored in localStorage, not settings.json file
**Solution**: 
- Updated splash screen to read theme directly from localStorage
- Added fallback to system theme detection
- Removed complex IPC theme reading

### 2. Splash Screen Getting Stuck
**Problem**: Splash screen gets stuck on app restart
**Root Cause**: Poor state management and window cleanup
**Solution**:
- Added proper state management with `isSplashComplete` flag
- Added timeout management with `splashTimeout` variable
- Added proper window cleanup and null checks
- Added duplicate request prevention

## Key Changes Made

### Main Process (`src/main/main.ts`)
1. **Added timeout management**: `splashTimeout` variable to track timeout
2. **Enhanced window cleanup**: Proper cleanup in `createSplashWindow()`
3. **Simplified theme handling**: Removed complex localStorage reading
4. **Better state reset**: Proper state reset on app activation

### Splash Screen (`src/renderer/scripts/splash.js`)
1. **Direct localStorage reading**: Reads theme directly from localStorage
2. **Enhanced debug logging**: Comprehensive console logging
3. **Better error handling**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
4. **Immediate theme application**: Applies theme immediately for better UX

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Theme Synchronization
1. Run the app: `npm start`
2. Open settings and change theme to dark mode
3. Close the app completely
4. Re-run the app: `npm start`
5. **Expected**: Splash screen should appear in dark mode

### Test 2: App Restart (No Stuck Splash)
1. Run the app: `npm start`
2. Let splash screen complete and main app appear
3. Close the app completely
4. Re-run the app: `npm start`
5. **Expected**: Splash screen should appear and complete normally

### Test 3: Debug Mode
1. Open DevTools in splash window (if possible)
2. Check console for debug messages:
   - "Splash screen DOM loaded, initializing..."
   - "Detecting theme for splash screen..."
   - "Found theme in localStorage: [light/dark]"
   - "Applied theme: [light/dark]"
   - "Splash completion notified to main process"

## Debug Commands

### Run Fixed Test Script
```bash
node test-splash-fixed.js
```

### Test Theme Reading
```bash
# Open test-theme.html in browser
open test-theme.html
```

### Check Console Logs
Look for these key messages:
- Theme detection logs
- Window creation/cleanup logs
- Timeout management logs
- Error messages

## Troubleshooting

### If Theme Still Not Syncing
1. Check if localStorage contains theme: `localStorage.getItem('theme')`
2. Check console for theme detection logs
3. Verify splash screen is reading from localStorage

### If Splash Still Gets Stuck
1. Check console for error messages
2. Look for timeout messages
3. Check if main window is being created
4. Verify state management is working

### Manual Testing
1. Use keyboard shortcuts in splash:
   - `Escape`: Skip splash immediately
   - `Enter/Space`: Complete splash immediately
2. Check if main window appears after shortcuts

## Expected Behavior

1. **First Run**: 
   - Splash appears in correct theme
   - Theme detected from localStorage
   - Main window created after splash completes

2. **Subsequent Runs**: 
   - Same as first run, no stuck splash
   - Proper state reset on restart
   - Clean window management

3. **Theme Changes**: 
   - Splash respects app theme setting
   - Immediate theme application
   - Fallback to system theme if needed

4. **Error Handling**: 
   - Graceful fallbacks if anything fails
   - Timeout protection (6 seconds)
   - Multiple recovery mechanisms
